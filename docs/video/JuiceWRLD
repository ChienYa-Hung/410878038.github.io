<p>Juice WRLD’s music is not entirely 
Hip-hop. His music also <span class="elements">incorporates 
some R&B, emo, and Rock </span> elements, and all of 
these are related to his birth. Juice WRLD’s 
parents divorced when he was three years old., 
And Juice WRLD lives with her mother and brother. 
Because her mother is a very pious Christian, when 
Juice WRLD was a child, he strictly restricted him 
from listening to hip-hop music. Juice WRKD also chose
Blink-182, Fall Out. Boy, Panic! at the Disco and other
popular rock bands’ music also shaped his special music 
style now</p>
