<p>Juice WRLD’s music is not entirely Hip-hop.  <br/>
His music also <span class="elements">incorporates some R&B, emo, and Rock </span> elements, and all of these are related to his birth.<br/>
Juice WRLD’s parents divorced when he was three years old. <br/>
And Juice WRLD lives with her mother and brother. <br/>
Because her mother is a very pious Christian, when Juice WRLD was a child, he strictly restricted him from listening to hip-hop music. <br/>
Juice WRKD also chose Blink-182, Fall Out. <br/>
Boy, Panic! at the Disco and other popular rock bands music also shaped his special music style now</p>
